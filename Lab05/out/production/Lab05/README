## Description
This project is a Rock Paper Scissors game developed using Swing.
It allows the user to play against a computer opponent that employs
multiple strategies and methods to determine its moves. The game
keeps track of player stats, wins, losses, and ties.

## Project Structure
- `src`: Contains the main source code for the application.
- `resources`: Holds the image files used for the game buttons (rock, paper, scissors).
- `CheatStrat.java`: Implements a strategy where the computer tries to predict the player's next move based on their last choice.
- `LastUsedStrat.java`: Uses the player's last move to determine the computer's move.
- `LeastUsedStrat.java`: Chooses the computer's move based on the player's least used move.
- `MostUsedStrat.java`: Selects the computer's move based on the player's most used move.
- `RandomStrat.java`: Randomly selects a move for the computer.
- `RockPaperScissorsFrame.java`: The main class for the game that initializes the user interface and handles game logic.
